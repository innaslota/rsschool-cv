## About Me
#### My Background
Hi, my name is Inna (as you apparently already know), and now I'm based in Ukraine, Lviv. I am an Experienced Customer Success Specialist seeking front-end development opportunities. And it may surprise you, so I am going to elaborate on it below.

I have always liked Information Technology and foreign languages at school. When I had to enter the university, I gave preference to languages, but the desire for computer science never left me. Therefore, just after graduation, I found a job that matched my competencies in an IT company. I have been constantly improving my skills and in 2021 I ended up at the Wix Answers team as a Customer Success Specialist. It was here that I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript thanks to my amazing teammates. I really liked programming, and then I decided to grow in this direction.

Therefore, in 2022, I was studying on my own using JavaScript textbooks, went through various boot camps, did daily exercises, and got into the SheCodes academy, where I successfully completed 4 courses. Now I continue to study, develop my skills, and learn new programming techniques. You can review my portfolio including all my projects on this [website](https://graceful-wisp-99d226.netlify.app/index.html). 

#### My Hobbies
But my interests do not stop at work and programming. I am a very active, positive person who loves life, so in my free time, I enjoy traveling, laughing and making jokes, engaging in outdoor activities such as rafting, hiking, fishing, and cycling. I also enjoy DIY. Specifically, I create and sell homemade scented candles, adore baking cakes, painting, and decorating. As well, I knit winter clothes for me and my family and like embroidering.
